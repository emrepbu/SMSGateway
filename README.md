# SMS Gateway

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Development-yellow)

SMS Gateway is an Android application that captures incoming SMS messages, filters them based on customizable rules, and forwards them to specified email addresses. This application is ideal for monitoring important notifications, security alerts, or business messages without constantly checking your phone.

## üì± Features

- **SMS Interception**: Instantly captures incoming SMS messages using Android's BroadcastReceiver system
- **Customizable Filtering**: Create filter rules with pattern matching to process only relevant messages
- **Email Forwarding**: Automatically forwards filtered messages to configured email addresses
- **Background Processing**: Reliable background operation with WorkManager integration
- **Message Storage**: Stores all messages locally with Room database for reference and status tracking
- **Clean Architecture**: Built using MVVM architecture with use cases and repositories
- **Modern UI**: Intuitive user interface built with Jetpack Compose

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SMS Gateway follows clean architecture principles with a focus on separation of concerns:

## üìä How It Works

    participant OS as Android OS
    participant SR as SmsReceiver
    participant WM as WorkManager
    participant PW as ProcessSmsWorker
    participant Repo as Repository
    participant UC as Use Cases

    OS->>SR: 1. SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION
    SR->>WM: 2. enqueue(processWorkRequest)
    WM->>PW: 3. doWork()
    PW->>Repo: 4. insertMessage(sms)
    Repo-->>PW: 5. success
    PW->>UC: 6. processNewSmsUseCase(sms)
    UC->>UC: 7. applyFilterUseCase()
    UC->>UC: 8. sendEmailForSmsUseCase()
    UC-->>PW: 9. ForwardResult
    PW->>Repo: 10. updateSmsForwardStatus(id, true)
    
    Note over OS,UC: Key Points:<br/>- SMS processing happens in background using WorkManager for reliability<br/>- Clean architecture separates concerns: UI, business logic, and data access
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### SMS Handling Process

When an SMS is received, the following process takes place:

1. `SmsReceiver` captures the incoming message via the `SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION` broadcast.
2. Message details are extracted and passed to a `WorkManager` task.
3. `ProcessSmsWorker` stores the message in the local database and calls the `ProcessNewSmsUseCase`.
4. Filter rules are applied to check if the message matches any criteria.
5. If there are matches, the message is forwarded to the corresponding email addresses.
6. The message status is updated in the database.

### Message Filtering System

The filter system allows users to create rules based on:

- Sender phone number (exact match or partial patterns)
- Message content (keywords, phrases, or regex patterns)
- Message type
- Priority levels

### Email Forwarding Service

SMS Gateway uses Jakarta Mail to send emails with:

- Customizable email subjects
- SMS content in the email body
- Sender information
- Timestamp information
- Optional email templates

## üìÑ Requirements

- Android 9.0 (API level 28) or higher
- SMS permissions granted
- Internet connection for email forwarding
- Configured email service settings

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All messages are stored only on your device
- Email configuration is stored securely
- No data is sent to external servers except for authorized email forwarding
- Filter processing happens entirely on-device

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install the SMS Gateway application
2. Grant required permissions (SMS reading and Internet)
3. Configure your filter rules
4. Set up email forwarding options
5. The app will now automatically process incoming messages

## üì± User Interface

The app features a clean, modern interface built with Jetpack Compose:

- Home screen displays all received messages with forwarding status
- Filter rule editor for creating and managing filtering criteria
- Email configuration screen for setting up forwarding destinations
- Settings screen for general application configurations
