# SMS Gateway

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Development-yellow)

SMS Gateway is an Android application that captures incoming SMS messages, filters them based on customizable rules, and forwards them to specified email addresses or API endpoints. This application is ideal for monitoring important notifications, security alerts, or business messages without constantly checking your phone.

  participant OS as Android OS
  participant SR as SmsReceiver
  participant WM as WorkManager
  participant PW as ProcessSmsWorker

  participant UC as Use Cases
  participant API as API Service
  participant Email as Email Service

  WM->>PW: 3. doWork()
  PW->>Repo: 4. insertMessage(sms)
  Repo-->>PW: 5. success
  PW->>UC: 6. processNewSmsUseCase(sms)
  UC->>UC: 7. applyFilterUseCase()

  alt API forwarding enabled
    UC->>UC: 8. sendSmsToApiUseCase()
    UC->>API: 9. sendSmsData(sms)
    API-->>UC: 10. ApiResponse
  else Email forwarding enabled
    UC->>UC: 11. sendEmailForSmsUseCase()
    UC->>Email: 12. sendEmail(sms)
    Email-->>UC: 13. EmailResult
  end

  UC-->>PW: 14. ForwardResult
  PW->>Repo: 15. updateSmsForwardStatus(id, true)

  Note over OS,UC: Key Points:<br/>- SMS processing happens in background using WorkManager for reliability<br/>- Clean architecture separates concerns: UI, business logic, and data access<br/>- Messages can be forwarded to API endpoints or email addresses
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### SMS Handling Process

When an SMS is received, the following process takes place:

1. `SmsReceiver` captures the incoming message via the `SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION` broadcast.
2. Message details are extracted and passed to a `WorkManager` task.
3. `ProcessSmsWorker` stores the message in the local database and calls the `ProcessNewSmsUseCase`.
4. Filter rules are applied to check if the message matches any criteria.
5. If there are matches, the message is forwarded to the corresponding email addresses and/or API endpoints.
6. The message status is updated in the database.

### Message Filtering System

The filter system allows users to create rules based on:

- Sender phone number (exact match or partial patterns)
- Message content (keywords, phrases, or regex patterns)
- Message type
- Priority levels

### Email Forwarding Service

SMS Gateway uses Jakarta Mail to send emails with:

- Customizable email subjects
- SMS content in the email body
- Sender information
- Timestamp information
- Optional email templates

### API Integration

SMS Gateway can forward SMS data to custom API endpoints using Ktor:

- Configurable API URL and authentication parameters
- JSON payload with SMS data
- HTTP request customization (headers, method)
- Response handling and error management
- Automatic retry for failed requests
- Support for various authentication methods (Basic, Bearer token, etc.)
- Connection pooling and timeout configuration for reliable communication

## üìÑ Requirements

- Android 9.0 (API level 28) or higher
- SMS permissions granted
- Internet connection for email forwarding and API communication
- Configured email service settings
- API endpoint (if using API integration)

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All messages are stored only on your device
- Email and API configuration is stored securely
- No data is sent to external servers except for authorized email forwarding or API endpoints
- Filter processing happens entirely on-device
- API communication uses HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Options for custom security headers and authentication tokens

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install the SMS Gateway application
2. Grant required permissions (SMS reading and Internet)
3. Configure your filter rules
4. Set up email forwarding options and/or API endpoint details
5. The app will now automatically process incoming messages

## üì± User Interface

The app features a clean, modern interface built with Jetpack Compose:

- Home screen displays all received messages with forwarding status
- Filter rule editor for creating and managing filtering criteria
- Email configuration screen for setting up forwarding destinations
- API configuration screen for setting up API integration
- Settings screen for general application configurations
